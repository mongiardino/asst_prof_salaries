* County-level cost of living for family of 2 adults and 2 children for year 2023: [Economic Policy Institute Family Budget Map](https://www.epi.org/resources/budget/budget-map/)
* List of public R1 institution in the US: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States)


Assignment of county (or unincorporated cities) to universities was done by hand and based on the city where the main campus is located according to Wikipedia. For large cities spanning multiple counties, cost of living is the average between all of them.
